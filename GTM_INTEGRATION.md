# Google Tag Manager Integration - Starlight Project

## Overview
Successfully integrated Google Tag Manager (GTM) with GTM ID: `GTM-WLJ5D4C` into your Starlight documentation site.

## Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified:

1. **`src/components/Head.astro`** - Custom head component containing GTM scripts
2. **`astro.config.mjs`** - Updated configuration to use the custom Head component

### What Was Added:

1. **GTM Script (Head)**: The main GTM tracking script that loads in the `<head>` section
2. **GTM Noscript Fallback**: Ensures tracking works even when JavaScript is disabled

### Technical Implementation:

The integration follows Google's recommended implementation:
- The main GTM script loads asynchronously in the head
- A noscript fallback iframe is dynamically inserted into the body for users with JavaScript disabled
- Both use your specific GTM container ID: `GTM-WLJ5D4C`

### Verification:

✅ Build completed successfully  
✅ GTM code is present in all generated HTML pages  
✅ Both script and noscript implementations are working  
✅ No errors or conflicts with Starlight framework  

## Usage

The GTM integration is now active on all pages of your Starlight site. You can:

1. **Start the dev server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Build for production**: `npm run build`
3. **Configure tracking in GTM**: Log into your Google Tag Manager account and set up tags, triggers, and variables as needed

## Next Steps

1. Configure your tags, triggers, and variables in the Google Tag Manager interface
2. Test the implementation using GTM's preview mode
3. Deploy your site to production

The integration is complete and ready for use!
