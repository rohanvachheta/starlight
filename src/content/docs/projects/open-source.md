## üöÄ Starting Your Open Source Journey

Based on my experience, here are some tips for getting started with open source:

### For Beginners
1. **Start Small**: Look for "good first issue" labels
2. **Read Documentation**: Understand the project before contributing
3. **Follow Guidelines**: Each project has its own contribution guidelines
4. **Be Patient**: Code reviews take time, be open to feedback

### Finding Projects
- **GitHub Explore**: Discover trending repositories
- **Up For Grabs**: Curated list of beginner-friendly projects
- **CodeTriage**: Get issues delivered to your inbox
- **First Timers Only**: Projects specifically for new contributors

### Making Impact
- **Fix Bugs**: Start with small bug fixes
- **Improve Documentation**: Often overlooked but very valuable
- **Add Tests**: Help improve code coverage
- **Optimize Performance**: Profile and improve slow code paths
